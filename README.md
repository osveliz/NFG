NFG is Normal Form Game tournament software developed using Java 8 but will most likely also work for Java 7 (and likely 9)

To build and execute this code you can do two things:
1. Use ant by simply typing the command `ant` in the command line (ant needs to be installed [http://ant.apache.org/](http://ant.apache.org/))
	If the output is too long ant will only show the first part of it.
	To manually run the compiled jar type `java -jar build/jar/NFG.jar`
2. Import the code to your favorite IDE and execute it that way

To build the javadoc use the command `ant doc`
